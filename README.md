# KuCoin Trailing Stop-Loss

## Installation

1) Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), and make sure you check the box which says: "Add Python VERSION to PATH".  
  

2) In a command terminal / cmd window, navigate to the KucoinTrailingStopLoss folder and install the python packages using pip (keep the terminal open once finished):
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

3) Create a KuCoin API and make sure to enable "trade" access.  


4) Open tslk.py in a text-editor of you choice and fill in the API credentials where it says:  
   **YOUR STUFF GOES HERE**
   
## Execution

In the same terminal window from before, while still in the KucoinTrailingStopLoss folder, you can run the script like so:

```
python tslk.py
```
or  
```
python3 tlsk.py
```

Follow the instructions. Please be sure about your input.  

Enjoy.
